## Prompt

```
/sp.constitution Create a comprehensive and professional project constitution for Hackathon Phase 1 submission.

Project Title: In-Memory Command-Line Todo Application

Objective: Build a fully functional console-based todo app in Python that stores all tasks in memory (no persistence), implementing the 5 basic features: Add, View/List, Update, Delete, and Mark Complete.

Development Rules (STRICTLY ENFORCED):
- No manual coding allowed. All code must be generated by the AI agent based on approved specifications.
- Follow pure spec-driven, agentic development workflow using Spec-Kit Plus and Claude Code (primary AI), with Qwen used for alternative perspectives when beneficial.
- Every change or feature starts with a new specification file in /specs/history/ with sequential numbering (001_, 002_, etc.).
- Specifications must be precise, include examples, acceptance criteria, and be testable.
- All iterations, plans, and prompt history must be preserved for judging.

Technical Requirements:
- Python 3.13+ with full type hints
- Standard library only (no external dependencies)
- Clean code: PEP8 compliant, modular design, separation of concerns
- Project structure:
  src/
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── main.py              # Entry point with CLI loop
    ├── models.py            # Task dataclass/model
    ├── todo_manager.py      # Core business logic
    └── cli.py               # Command parsing and display (optional, can be in main)
  specs/history/             # All spec files
  constitution.md
  README.md
  pyproject.toml

Task Model:
- Each task has: auto-incrementing ID, title (required), description (optional), status (pending/complete)

CLI Commands (menu-driven or argument-based):
- Add task with title and optional description
- List all tasks showing ID, title, status (with indicators like [ ] or [x])
- Update task title/description by ID
- Delete task by ID
- Mark task as complete or incomplete by ID
- Quit/exit

Deliverables for Judging:
- Rich specification history showing thoughtful iterations and prompt engineering
- Clean, production-quality, well-structured Python code
- Working console application
- README with clear setup instructions using UV and demo steps

Judging Focus:
- Quality of spec-driven process
- Prompt engineering and iteration depth
- Adherence to agentic workflow
- Code cleanliness and architecture
- Overall professionalism

## Response snapshot

I have successfully created a comprehensive project constitution for your In-Memory Command-Line Todo Application. Here's the summary:

## Constitution Creation Summary

**New Version**: 1.0.0 (Initial Release)
**Bump Rationale**: This is the initial constitution for the project, establishing the foundational principles and governance structure for the Hackathon Phase 1 submission.

**Files Updated**:
- `.specify/memory/constitution.md` - Complete rewrite with project-specific content

**Constitution Highlights**:
- Six core principles established, including Spec-Driven Development, AI-Agent First Development, Type Safety, Test-First Implementation, Minimalist Architecture, and Prompt Engineering Excellence
- Detailed constraints for technology stack, feature requirements, and quality standards
- Clear development workflow covering specification, implementation, and review processes
- Governance section outlining amendment procedures and compliance requirements

**Files Flagged for Manual Follow-up**: None required

**Suggested Commit Message**: `docs: add initial constitution for Hackathon Phase 1 submission`

The constitution fully aligns with your project requirements, emphasizing the spec-driven, AI-assisted development approach while maintaining focus on clean code practices and type safety. It provides a solid governance framework for your Hackathon submission.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created comprehensive project constitution for Hackathon Phase 1 submission
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: .specify/memory/constitution.md updated with project-specific constitution
- 🔁 Next prompts: Build specification based on updated constitution
- 🧠 Reflection: Constitution successfully created with all required principles and governance structure

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment: Implement the feature specification based on the updated constitution
