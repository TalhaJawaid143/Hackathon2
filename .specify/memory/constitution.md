# In-Memory Command-Line Todo Application Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Spec-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All development must follow a strict spec-driven workflow using Spec-Kit Plus tools. Every feature, change, or bug fix must start with a detailed specification in the specs/history/ directory with sequential numbering (001_, 002_, etc.). Specifications must be precise, include examples, acceptance criteria, and be testable before any implementation begins.

### II. AI-Agent First Development
All code must be generated by AI agents based on approved specifications. No manual coding is allowed. The primary AI agent (Claude Code) will be used for development with Qwen providing alternative perspectives when beneficial. This ensures consistency, documentation, and adherence to specifications.

### III. Type Safety and Clean Code
All Python code must use full type hints (Python 3.13+), be PEP8 compliant, and follow clean code principles. The codebase must have modular design with clear separation of concerns. Standard library only - no external dependencies are allowed.

### IV. Test-First Implementation
All features must be developed using TDD methodology. Tests must be written before implementation, and the Red-Green-Refactor cycle must be strictly enforced. Every feature must have corresponding tests that verify functionality and edge cases.

### V. Minimalist Architecture
The application must maintain a simple, focused architecture with clear separation between data models, business logic, and CLI interface. Follow the principle of starting simple and only adding complexity when justified by requirements.

### VI. Prompt Engineering Excellence
All interactions with AI agents must use high-quality prompts that include clear context, specific requirements, examples, and acceptance criteria. Prompt history must be preserved for reproducibility and learning.

## Additional Constraints

### Technology Stack
- Python 3.13+ with full type hints
- Standard library only (no external dependencies)
- Project structure must follow the specified directory layout:
  - src/: Contains all source code
  - specs/history/: All specification files
  - README.md: Setup and usage instructions
  - pyproject.toml: Project configuration

### Feature Requirements
- Core functionality: Add, View/List, Update, Delete, and Mark Complete tasks
- Task model: auto-incrementing ID, title (required), description (optional), status (pending/complete)
- CLI interface: menu-driven or argument-based with clear user feedback
- In-memory storage only (no persistence)

### Quality Standards
- All code must be production-quality with proper error handling
- Documentation must be clear and comprehensive
- Code must be modular and maintainable

## Development Workflow

### Specification Process
- Every change starts with a new specification file in specs/history/ with sequential numbering
- Specifications must include examples, acceptance criteria, and be testable
- Specifications must be reviewed and approved before implementation begins
- All iterations and prompt history must be preserved

### Implementation Process
- Implementation must strictly follow approved specifications
- Code generation must be done by AI agents only
- Regular validation against specifications during development
- Continuous testing throughout the implementation process

### Review Process
- All changes must be reviewed against specifications
- Code quality and adherence to principles must be verified
- Test coverage and functionality must be validated
- Prompt history and specification compliance must be confirmed

## Governance

This constitution governs all development practices for the In-Memory Command-Line Todo Application. All team members must adhere to these principles and processes. Amendments to this constitution require documentation of the change, approval from project stakeholders, and a migration plan for existing code and specifications.

All pull requests and code reviews must verify compliance with these principles. Any deviation from these principles must be explicitly justified and approved.
